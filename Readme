#List of the main tools used in this project and what each one did

| Tool           | Purpose |
|----------------|---------|
| **ART**        | Simulated paired-end Illumina reads at controlled coverage levels |
| **FastQC**     | Checked the quality of each read dataset |
| **MultiQC**    | Combined all FastQC reports into one summary |
| **SPAdes**     | Assembled the genomes from read data |
| **QUAST**      | Evaluated the quality of each genome assembly |
| **CheckM**     | Estimated genome completeness and contamination (no pplacer used) |
| **Bandage**    | Visualised the assembly graphs for structural clarity |
| **FastANI**    | Compared assembled genomes to references using Average Nucleotide Identity |
| **Bowtie2**    | Aligned simulated reads to their matching reference genomes |
| **SAMtools**   | Converted, sorted, and indexed alignment files |
| **Qualimap**   | Summarised mapping coverage and insert size stats |
| **Pathogenwatch** | Used online for species identification from raw reads and assemblies |
